            I was just trying to buy a pair of shoes,something stylish,
            something that felt like me. But the deeper I went, the more lost I
            felt. Endless tabs. No real guidance. And no idea what would
            actually go with what. By the time I found something I liked, I
            didn't even want it anymore.
            <br />
            <br/>
            
            So I started asking around. Turns out, I wasn't the only one. People
            told me: <br />
            "I never find anything that fits right." <br />
            "I return half the things I buy." <br />
            "I don't know what actually suits me."
            <br />
            <br/>
            That's when it clicked,it's not the people who are the problem.
            It's the system.
            <br />
            <br/>
            We created MyMirro to change that. MyMirro isn't about transactions.
            It's about transformation,into someone who feels confident,
            stylish, and completely themselves. <br />
            <br />
            We're not just another marketplace. We're your fashion partner.{" "}
            <br />

            And this is just the beginning.
